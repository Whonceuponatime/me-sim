# Main Engine Simulation Configuration for Linux Deployment
# This configuration is optimized for remote deployment on Linux VMs

modbus:
  host: "0.0.0.0"    # Bind to all interfaces for remote access
  port: 502          # Standard Modbus TCP port (requires root or use port 5020)

engine:
  # RPM ranges
  rpm_min: 600
  rpm_max: 1200
  rpm_normal: 900
  
  # Temperature ranges (°C)
  temp_min: 70
  temp_max: 120
  temp_normal: 85
  
  # Fuel flow ranges (tons/hour)
  fuel_flow_min: 0.5
  fuel_flow_max: 2.5
  fuel_flow_normal: 1.5

  # Update interval (seconds) - optimized for network transmission
  update_interval: 1.0

# WARNING: These registers are publicly accessible without authentication
# This demonstrates real-world SCADA/ICS security vulnerabilities
registers:
  status: 0          # 0: Stopped, 1: Running, 2: Warning, 3: Alarm
  rpm: 1             # Current RPM value
  temp: 2            # Current temperature (°C)
  fuel_flow: 3       # Current fuel flow (tons/hour * 100)
  load: 4            # Current load percentage

# Security monitoring settings
security:
  log_unauthorized_access: true
  max_unauthorized_attempts: 5
  alert_threshold: 3
  
# Network settings for remote deployment
network:
  # Allow connections from any IP (for demonstration purposes)
  # In production, this should be restricted to specific IP ranges
  allowed_networks:
    - "0.0.0.0/0"  # WARNING: Allows all IPs - for demonstration only
  
  # Firewall considerations:
  # - Port 502 (Modbus TCP) must be open
  # - Consider using non-standard ports for additional security
  
# Deployment notes:
# 1. Run with sudo for port 502, or use port 5020 without sudo
# 2. Configure firewall to allow Modbus TCP traffic
# 3. This configuration demonstrates industrial protocol vulnerabilities
